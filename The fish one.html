<h3>Day one: Knowing I may not survive, I still take the coconut drinking the last of it's milk.
I wish I had some more, it'd be nice if I could just go back home and drink all of the
coconut milk in the world.  
</h3>
<h3>Day two: Today there was a mysterious figure lurking around my campsite, I'm not all to sure
as to what it was. I screeched a horrid noise hoping I could get it's attention,
instead I was surprisingly greeted with a retreat by the creature.
</h3>
<h3>Day three: I have officially run out of rations meaning I must now leave the campsite, hoping
to find something I bring my uncles trusty pocket watch as a reminder to keep up my spirit, the one thing that survived the roughage.
