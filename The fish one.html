<h3>Day 31: Knowing I may not survive, I still take the coconut drinking the last of it's milk.
I wish I had some more, it'd be nice if I could just go back home and drink all of the
coconut milk in the world.  
</h3>
<h3>Day 34: Today there was a mysterious figure lurking around my campsite, I'm not all to sure
as to what it was. I screeched a horrid noise hoping I could get it's attention,
instead I was surprisingly greeted with a retreat by the creature.
</h3>
<h3>Day 40: I have officially run out of rations meaning I must now leave the campsite, hoping
to find something I bring my uncles trusty pocket watch as a reminder to keep up my spirit, the
one thing that survived the roughage.  
</h3>
<h3>Day 42: It's so cold out and I haven't been able to find anything. I lost my weapons during the
chase that ensued with the creature I had encountered earlier, and now I pray to god I can at least even
find one harosho at this point, my stomach rumbles louder and louder every time I think about it.
</h3>
<h3>Day 43: I have taken a huge gash to the leg and taken shelter inside of a cave. The creature
had caught up to me quite quickly, and only then I finally got a glimpse at this beast. He had a broad
extensive amount of muscle pulsating from within, he had one of the coldest dead set of eyes I've ever seen,
they were as dark as the abyss itself...I bared not look more, i shifted my head away in fear as of what to come.
</h3>
<h3>Day ??: I'm not sure if I can keep going...the creature ended up coming back and has stayed outside
of the cave for days now..what day is it even now...I'm not sure It's been so long. I can't even stand...
I feel so weak and heavy..maybe if I go to sleep I'll wake up from this nightmare. Maybe I'll wake up
beside Jessie in bed again...only to be promptly greeted by my daughter screaming daddy wake up for
breakfast...I hope someone comes soon.
</h3>
